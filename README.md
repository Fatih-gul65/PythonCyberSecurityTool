Cyber Security Toolkit
PythonLicensePlatformContributions welcome

A comprehensive, GUI-based cybersecurity toolkit built with Python and PyQt5. This project consolidates essential tools for network analysis, penetration testing, and educational purposes into a single, user-friendly interface.

üìñ About The Project
This toolkit was created to provide a simple yet powerful interface for common cybersecurity tasks. By leveraging powerful libraries like Scapy, Requests, and PyQt5, it makes complex network operations more accessible for security professionals, students, and enthusiasts alike. Each tool is designed as a modular component within a unified application.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Tools
The toolkit includes the following modules:

Port Scanner: A multi-threaded scanner to quickly discover open ports on a target IP or a range of IPs.
Packet Sniffer: A real-time network traffic analyzer that captures packets and allows filtering by protocol (e.g., TCP, ICMP).
ARP Spoofer: Executes ARP poisoning attacks to intercept traffic on a local network, useful for simulating Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) scenarios.
Wi-Fi Scanner: Detects and lists nearby wireless networks, displaying their SSID, signal strength, and security protocols. (Linux-specific)
MAC Changer: Temporarily modifies the MAC address of a network interface to enhance privacy or bypass MAC-based filters. (Linux-specific)
Whois & DoS Tool: Performs Whois lookups to gather domain registration information and can launch a basic HTTP Flood DoS simulation for stress testing purposes.
Brute-Force ZIP Cracker: Attempts to crack password-protected ZIP archives using a dictionary-based attack.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get the toolkit running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
pip (Python Package Installer)
A Linux-based Operating System is recommended, as the Wi-Fi Scanner and MAC Changer depend on Linux system commands (nmcli, ifconfig).
Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/Fatih-gul65/PythonCyberSecurityTool.git
cd PythonCyberSecurityTool
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

text
PyQt5
scapy
requests
python-whois
wifi
Then, install them using pip:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
üöÄ How to Run
Because several tools require elevated privileges to capture packets or modify network interfaces (e.g., Packet Sniffer, ARP Spoofer, MAC Changer), you must run the application with sudo.

sh
sudo python3 main.py
Once the application is running, select the desired tool from the interface, fill in the required fields, and start the operation.
